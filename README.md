# L. V. Tarasov Book Collection
A repo for books by L. V. Tarasov
This repo will have scanned pdf files and latex source files and supporting image files for compiling books by L. V. Tarasov published by Mir Publishers.

Currently the following books have been added to this repository

1. Questions and Answers in School Physics by Lev Tarasov and Aldina Tarasova
2. Basic Concepts of Quantum Mechanics by L. V. Tarasov

Both the books use the latex-tufte book class for compilation with a few additional packages. See the packages used in the preamble of the files for the exact packages required.
